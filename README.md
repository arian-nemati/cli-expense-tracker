A simple command-line expense tracker built with Python.  
This program allows users to manage their daily expenses and view total spending grouped by category.


## Description

Expense Tracker is a CLI-based Python application that helps users record expenses, view them, remove entries, and calculate total spending per category as well as overall expenses.


## Motivation

This project was built as a practice project to strengthen core Python skills, including:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Basic application architecture
- Input validation
- Working with lists and dictionaries
- Writing clean and readable CLI programs
